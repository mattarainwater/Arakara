It is the 4th year of Cator's Conquest. Many have fallen beneath the banner of the Kytosi Empire. #type:crawl
The latest inevitable casuality of Kytosi aggression is the city-state of Vykengaard. #type:crawl
While their fierce warrior-priests have fought valiantly, the Imperial 3rd legion is days away from launching a siege to end their resistance. #type:crawl
But Cator is not a patient woman. They have dispatched Their personal agents to enter the city and shatter any resistance from the inside. #type:crawl

Well, rook, what's it look like down there. #name:Woman #portrait:Prisca

Refugees are flooding in from the surrounding farmlands. It won't be a problem to slip in unnoticed, Captain. #name:Man #portrait:Caius
The 4th legion is just a day's march away, right? With that many mouths to feed and the state of those walls... they won't last a week. #name:Man #portrait:Caius
Why are we here? #name:Man #portrait:Caius

Listen up, rook. We're agents of the Kytosi Empire, Cator's own will. #name:Woman #portrait:Prisca
We could let the army march in and burn the city to ground, but then Cator's ruling over ashes. And They want an empire. #name:Woman #portrait:Prisca
We're here to take the city as intact as they'll let us. We do our job right, and the 4th just waltzes to keep the peace. #name:Woman #portrait:Prisca

Captain, befor- #name:Man #portrait:Caius

One more thing, we're in the field. No need for formalities, just call me Prisca, rook. #name:Prisca #portrait:Prisca

Does that mean you'll start calling me Caius? #name:Caius #portrait:Caius

Ha, maybe if I decide you've been useful. You're still green, rook. #name:Prisca #portrait:Prisca

Very well, let's go over the targets. #name:Caius #portrait:Caius
